For the majority of these projects, data collection, analysis, and curation are currently done by hand, which requires individual investigators to spend considerable time on data management rather than science.\r\n###Project\r\nSupported by The National Science Foundation, this project will develop and disseminate tools and systems for managing RFID transponder reads.\r\n\r\n###Code\r\nCode for the project is managed on [GitHub](https://github.com/etag).\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-51190613-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
